## Learning from Data

- [Introduction to Data-Centric AI](https://dcai.csail.mit.edu/) - Improving the dataset itself rather than treating it as fixed. Data-Centric AI (DCAI) is an emerging science that studies techniques to improve datasets, which is often the best way to improve performance in practical ML applications. DCAI considers the improvement of data as a systematic engineering discipline.

- [The Principles of Data-Centric AI: Uniting data-centric perspectives and concepts to trace the foundations of DCAI](https://cacm.acm.org/research/the-principles-of-data-centric-ai/) - Principles for dataset design, versioning, labeling consistency, augmentation, and evaluation shifting focus from models to data.

- [Data-Centric Artificial Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/html/2212.11854v4) - Introducing data-centric AI as a complementary and mutually beneficial paradigm to model-centric AI by defining relevant terms, introducing key characteristics to contrast both the paradigms, and introducing a framework for data-centric AI.


## Preprocessing

- [About Feature Scaling and Normalization – and the effect of standardization for machine learning algorithms](https://sebastianraschka.com/Articles/2014_about_feature_scaling.html)
Sebastian Raschka's blog on feature scaling and normalization compares of standardization with normalization and mentions when each is appropriate.

- [Image Preprocessing Best Practices To Optimize Your AI Workflows](https://voxel51.com/blog/image-preprocessing-best-practices-to-optimize-your-ai-workflows) - Voxel51 blog brings image preprocessing best practices with practical guidance on resizing strategies, normalization choices, and handling domain shifts with visualization in mind.

## Data Augmentation & Robustness

- [Automating Data Augmentation: Practice, Theory and New Direction](https://ai.stanford.edu/blog/data-augmentation/) - Stanford AI Lab blog provides overview of search-based policies such as _AutoAugment_ and _RandAugment_, and their trade-offs in practice.

- [Albumentations Tutorial for Data Augmentation (PyTorch focused)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAdLwKJBvPM). YouTube video by Aladdin Persson shows fast image augmentations, composing pipelines, and visualizing results in a step-by-step manner.
