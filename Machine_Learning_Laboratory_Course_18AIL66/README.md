**Course Learning Objectives:** This course will enable students to implement and evaluate Machine Learning algorithms in Python programming language.

**Program List:**

|  Serial No. | Description  |
| ------------ | ------------ |
| 1 | Implement and demonstrate theFIND-S algorithm for finding the most specific hypothesis based on a given set of training data samples. Read the training data from a .CSV file and show the output for test cases. Develop an interactive program by Compareing the result by implementing LIST-THEN-ELIMINATE algorithm.  |
| 2 | For a given set of training data examples stored in a .CSV file, implement and demonstrate the Candidate-Elimination algorithm. Output a description of the set of all hypotheses consistent with the training examples.  |
| 3 | Demonstrate Pre processing (Data Cleaning, Integration and Transformation) activity on suitable data. For example: Identify and Delete Rows that Contain Duplicate Data by considering an appropriate dataset. Identify and Delete Columns That Contain a Single Value by considering an appropriate dataset.  |
| 4 | Demonstrate the working of the decision tree based ID3 algorithm. Use an appropriate data set for building the decision tree and apply this knowledge to classify a new sample.  |
| 5 | Demonstrate the working of the Random Forests algorithm. Use an appropriate data set for building and apply this knowledge to classify a new sample.  |
| 6 | Implement the Na√Øve Bayesian classifier for a sample training data set stored as a .CSV file. Compute the accuracy of the classifier, considering few test data sets.  |
| 7 |  Assuming a set of documents that need to be classified, use the Naive Bayesian Classifier model to perform this task. Calculate the accuracy, precision, and recall for your data set. |
| 8 | Construct a Bayesian network considering medical data. Use this model to demonstrate the diagnosis of heart patients using standard Heart Disease Data Set.  |
| 9 | Demonstrate the working of EM algorithm to cluster a set of data stored in a .CSV file.  |
|10| Demonstrate the working of SVM classifier for a suitable data set.  |
